              <h3>JavaScript</h3>
              <p>
                I've started learning JavaScript after the first year of college
                and feel comfortable with it. The fact that you can make an
                entire full-stack web application with it is a great thing. The
                only thing I'm not fond of is that it is weakly typed. Too much
                type inference is a recipe for disaster.
              </p>
              <h3>Java</h3>
              <p>
                During the first year of college I was introduced to Java and
                immediately loved how simple it made building more complex
                things. It is far from a perfect language, but it made coding
                fun for me and it also has a great community behind it.
              </p>
              <h3>Kotlin</h3>
              <p>
                Now we're talking. This is currently my favorite language. It
                picks up ideas that worked with Java and then improves
                everything that was done wrong. It is far less verbose, it has
                higher order functions etc. I would love to have a job where the
                main focus is Kotlin.
              </p>
              <h3>C</h3>
              <p>
                I've first seen this language in high school but fell in love
                with it in college when we did some more practical things with
                it. In my opinion learning C first is a really good idea as you
                get a deeper understanding of how data structures look like in
                memory. The same goes for Assembler. Although I prefer coding in
                higher level Languages, C gave me a deeper understanding of
                programming in general.

              <h3>Node.js</h3>
              <p>
                Node was a really great introduction into backend development.
                It taught me a lot of the core concepts of how to build a web
                server. It's the technology I would use on smaller projects.
              </p>
              <h3>Vue.js</h3>
              <p>
                Vue is a fantastic first reactive framework to learn. It is
                super simple to use and debug. It has shown me that frontend
                development can be fun.
              </p>
              <h3>Spring Boot</h3>
              <p>
                I've started learning Spring Boot in Infinum Academy. Building
                web services in Spring is quite enjoyable, the dependency
                injection and auto wiring aspects remind me of playing with Lego
                bricks. In my opinion the strictness of Java really comes into
                play here, debugging is a breeze.
              </p>
              <h3>PostgreSQL</h3>
              <p>
                I was taught Postgres in college, and while I don't have nearly
                enough experience with databases in general, I can't find
                complaints regarding Postgres. It just works. I'm a big fan
                relational databases.
              </p>
              <h3>MongoDB</h3>
              <p>
                MongoDB was my introduction to NoSQL and I've gotta say, it is
                pretty great for some use cases. Both Postgres and Mongo have
                pretty good APIs for Java and JavaScript and make working with
                databases quite easy to understand.
              </p>
              <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
              <p>
                I'm OK with HTML. Not much to say there. However CSS is not my
                favorite technology. I'm just not that good at design and
                technologies like CSS are not my strong point. Sass makes it a
                lot better though, but most of all I just like to use Bootstrap.
                I will say this though. I've had to use some CSS during an
                internship, and after a couple of days it actually starts making
                perfect sense. Still, I'll avoid it in the future.

              <h3>Git</h3>
              <p>
                I've used Git since first year of college and I'm quite
                comfortable with it. I can't say I mastered it though, there is
                always something new to learn. For example, did you know that
                Git doesn't track folders, only files? Well, you probably did.
                My mind was blown when I found out.
              </p>
              <h3>GitHub</h3>
              <p>
                This is just a really good piece of software. Definitely my
                repository of choice. Whether I have basic repository needs, or
                hosting with GitHub pages, it is always a pleasant experience.
              </p>
              <h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>
              <p>
                I'm a big fan of VSCode. You can really make a beautiful editor
                if you play around with settings and plugins. It is super useful
                and lightweight. What a great tool for programmers of all levels
                of seniority. And it's an Electron app that doesn't suck. What
                more could you want?
              </p>
              <h3>IntelliJ</h3>
              <p>
                This is just unmatched support in programming. I explore new
                features of this powerful app every day and it still feels like
                overkill. That's not even a bad thing in this case. If I had to
                pick one IDE to use, I'd pick IntelliJ.

                I've used some Docker but I feel there is still much to learn.
                The whole DevOps field with Ansible, Kubernetes etc. seems

              </p>
              <h3>Python</h3>
              <p>
                OK, I know how to use Python. But I don't feel like I've
                mastered it. And that's gonna change soon.

              <h3>Apache Spark</h3>
              <p>
                I don't plan on becoming a data analyst but the entire data
                field in computer science seems really cool and I would like to
                learn about the tools.

            After two years of college, backend development is the field I'm
            most interested in. I'm enthusiastic about design patterns and
            software architecture, as well as the development of microservices.
            The "How it works" is a lot more interesting to me than the "How it
            looks". Therefore I would also like to step into the world of
            DevOps.

          <p class="lead">
            I'm interested in data analysis, AI, machine learning etc. These
            fields aren't where I see myself working, but they are the future
            (and present) of app development. It doesn't matter if you're using
            GitHub Copilot while coding a basic website, or some data analysis
            tool while coding a complex application, these tools are here to
            stay, and I would like to understand what's going on.

          OK, now you've seen what I'm interested in. However, there is more. Go
          check out my GitHub and see what I've been playing with, or take a
          look at my LinkedIn for much more. I'm also open to any questions so
          feel free to contact me.
